## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/assets/images/me.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Hey there! If you’re here you must be curious about who I am and what I do, right? Well, my name is Ken Perry and I function as a Senior UC Engineer (Level 3) at a Managed Services Provider, Optanix. Through my UC Journey thus far I have functioned as a front line Service Desk engineer (with all the glory that entails), a Senior UC Engineer focusing on supporting/administrating/maintaining Cisco UC deployments including UCM, CUC, CER, IM&P, UCCX, IOS Gateways/VGs, CUBE, ESXi Hypervisor, Cisco UCS-C/B/E, UCSM and UCS Central, Unified SIP Proxy and more, typically in 20+ separate environments on a weekly basis. It can get crazy. I have also functioned as a “Day 1” implementation engineer building out “pilot” or “proof of concept” environments, including creating documentation and how-to training videos.

During my time as a Senior UC engineer I have also had the pleasure of training multiple engineers in UC & Data Center technologies, Case Management best practices and general business process related to Day 2 Support.

On the personal side I am a father to my son, Max, husband to my Anthropologist & Activist wife Chelsie, and feeder + poop picker upper to our animals Harley (Beagle), Thor & Loki (cats). My son was the inspiration for one of my side projects — scripting in Python. When he asked me “Dad, how do you learn how to code?” at the age of 5, I didn’t really have a good answer… but I told him that I would learn a language or two and do my best to teach him as he grew to see if it’s something he’d be into. Thus work on my UC Automation scripts started, which are now held on my GitHub page. The easiest entry point for coding (for me) is relevance. I also enjoy MMORPG video games, Dungeons & Dragons (when I can find a group), camping, going for walks throughout the neighborhood and on various nature trails/parks, and my blog to name a few things.

I started the NOC Thoughts blog as a way to give back to the IT community, bloggers, and folks that helped me along my way as well. Whether it was command syntax, use cases, informational posts or the occasionally necro’d thread on Cisco Support Forums holding the ever-so-important correct answer, I learned and gained a lot from the free flow of information from one engineer to another, and I want to be a part of that beautiful process.
