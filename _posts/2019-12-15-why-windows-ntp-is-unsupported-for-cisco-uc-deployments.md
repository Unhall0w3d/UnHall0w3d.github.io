## Windows NTP Is A No-Go

So as we all know as part of the UC VOS Deployments, NTP Servers are one element that needs to be configured during install time... and occasionally needs to be updated as things change on the network.  For those of you unsure of what devices are UC VOS, please see the list below.

<!--more-->

- Cisco CallManager
- Unity Connection
- Emergency Responder
- IM & Presence
- Media Sense
- Intelligence Center
- Finesse
- Contact Center Express

These devices all run on the same UC VOS Platform (as seen in a 'show status' command). And as part of the NTP deployment some of our basic responsibilities are to confirm that we have reachability to the NTP server through commands such as 'utils network ping ntp-ip' and 'utils network connectivity ntp-ip'. In later versions, such as 11.5, we can issue a 'utils network connectivity ntp-ip port 123', and we can verify connectivity to the NTP server on the NTP port itself.

Another responsibility that is often overlooked in the deployments I have worked in post-install is to ensure that the NTP server deployed supports NTPv4, and uses NTPv4 as it's network time protocol. A byproduct of this requirement that is often overlooked is that Windows based NTP servers should not be used in the environment. This is due to Windows NTP implementation being sNTP (Simple NTP). Due to this, when an NTP Client packet is received at the Windows based NTP server, an NTPv3 Server packet will be returned.

Now, most folks that keep up with NTP and the difference in the versions, what they support, what they don't, will know that NTPv4 is backwards compatible with NTPv3, so this should all be fine, right? Well, not in Cisco's case. As with most things, Cisco seems to have fiddled with their ntpdate implementation and do not support NTPv3. As I'll show in the example below, using a Windows based NTP server -- even if it works initially, is not stable and is not supported by Cisco.

## Behavior

1. NTP shows as Unsynchronized when issuing a 'utils ntp status'.
2. NTP servers defined are Domain Controllers (Windows based NTP).
3. No issue with NTP prior to environment power down for 2 days.

## Symptoms

-NTP Shows as Unsynchronized
admin:utils ntp status
ntpd (pid 20559) is runningâ€¦
unsynchronised
time server re-starting
polling server every 64 s
Current time in UTC is : Sat Dec 14 11:49:11 UTC 2019
Current time in America/Los_Angeles is : Sat Dec 14 03:49:11 PST 2019

## Troubleshooting

### When performing a packet capture on port 123 we can see a client packet sent out as NTPv4, with a server response of NTPv3.

So there we have it. Cisco says NTPv3 isn't supported. In this particular instance we were getting back NTPv3 Server packets which are primarily rejected and invalidates the NTP server leaving us unsynchronized.  As shown, it can have consequences relating to dbreplication, general date/time data displayed on CCM and thus on endpoints that rely on CCM for NTP and more.

Proper planning and due diligence go a long way here. Read Cisco documentation, blog posts, and actively lab whatever you can relating to the Cisco devices you support. This isn't something that is covered on a CCNA/CCNP Voice or Collab exam, and thus would likely not come up during study.  Normally I see this come up as a 'lesson learned' for the client after batting down every 'can't you just restart the service/server to fix this?' and 'it was working before, so it must have been something you did'. Deploy it correctly, follow SRND where applicable and possible.
